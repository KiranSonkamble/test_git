# I'm developer want get a copy of this repo

#1. "git branch" check the branches

# How to create a new branch
#2. " git branch branchName" new branch will be created named 'branchName'.
'''PS Z:\git_industry> git branch dev1
  dev1
* main '''

#3. check the current branch
'''PS Z:\git_industry> git checkout
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. '''

#4. switch to other branch
'''PS Z:\git_industry> git checkout dev1
Switched to branch 'dev1' '''

#### if branch switched/changed repo is copied to that branch #####

### update the files to git repo ###

#5. Now lets check the status
'''PS Z:\git_industry> git status
On branch dev1
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        branch_dev.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track) '''

#6-dev1. when I switched to main branch user, wrote 3 lines but in dev1 branch those lines missing that means
# this is another copy of same file. which willl be chnged by only dev1 user and will not effect other user branch. 

#9. lets merge dev1 branch with main branch.
